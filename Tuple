What is a Tuple?
A tuple is a collection of items in Python that:

Is ordered: The order of items is maintained.
Is immutable: Once created, you cannot change its elements (no adding, removing, or modifying items).
Can contain mixed data types: You can store numbers, strings, or even other tuples!
Tuples are defined using parentheses ( ), and the items are separated by commas.

How to Create a Tuple?
Empty Tuple:

empty_tuple = ()
print(empty_tuple)  # Output: ()

Tuple with One Item: Add a comma after the single item, or else Python treats it as a normal value:
single_item_tuple = (5,)
print(single_item_tuple)  # Output: (5,)

Tuple with Multiple Items:
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(fruits)  # Output: ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')

Mixed Data Types:
mixed_tuple = (1, "hello", 3.14)
print(mixed_tuple)  # Output: (1, 'hello', 3.14')

Without Parentheses: You can skip the parentheses, and Python will still treat it as a tuple:
numbers = 1, 2, 3
print(numbers)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)

Accessing Tuple Items
You can access tuple elements using indexing, where the first element is at index 0.

fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

# Access first item
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple

# Access last item (negative indexing)
print(fruits[-1])  # Output: cherry

Why are Tuples Immutable?
Since tuples are immutable, you cannot:
Add items
Remove items
Change items
This makes tuples useful when you want data to remain constant.

Tuple Methods
Even though tuples are immutable, you can still do some things:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Count Items: Count how many times an item appears.
numbers = (1, 2, 2, 3, 2)
print(numbers.count(2))  # Output: 3

Find an Item's Index: Get the position of an item.
numbers = (10, 20, 30, 40)
print(numbers.index(30))  # Output: 2

Loop Through a Tuple
You can use a loop to go through each item in a tuple.
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
Output:
apple
banana
cherry

Tuple Packing and Unpacking
Packing: Combine multiple values into a tuple.
Unpacking: Split a tuple into individual variables.

# Packing
person = ("Alice", 25, "Engineer")

# Unpacking
name, age, profession = person
print(name)       # Output: Alice
print(age)        # Output: 25
print(profession) # Output: Engineer

When to Use Tuples?
When the data shouldn't change (like a list of days in a week).
For faster operations since tuples are slightly faster than lists.
When you need a constant sequence to use as dictionary keys.

Summary
Tuples are ordered, immutable, and can hold mixed data types.
Use parentheses ( ) to define them.
Access elements using indexing.
Great for constant, unchanging data.
