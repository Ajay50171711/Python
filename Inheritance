In Python, inheritance allows one class (child class) to inherit the attributes and methods of another class (parent class). Python supports several types of inheritance, and here are the main types:

1. Single Inheritance
In single inheritance, a subclass inherits from a single parent class.

class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Bark"

dog = Dog()
print(dog.sound())  # Output: Bark


2. Multiple Inheritance
In multiple inheritance, a subclass inherits from more than one parent class.

class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Mammal:
    def breathe(self):
        return "Breathe air"

class Dog(Animal, Mammal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Bark"

dog = Dog()
print(dog.sound())  # Output: Bark
print(dog.breathe())  # Output: Breathe air

3. Multilevel Inheritance
In multilevel inheritance, a class is derived from a class which is also derived from another class.

class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Mammal(Animal):
    def has_fur(self):
        return True

class Dog(Mammal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Bark"

dog = Dog()
print(dog.sound())  # Output: Bark
print(dog.has_fur())  # Output: True

4. Hierarchical Inheritance
In hierarchical inheritance, multiple classes inherit from a single parent class.


class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Bark"

class Cat(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Meow"

dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

print(dog.sound())  # Output: Bark
print(cat.sound())  # Output: Meow

5. Hybrid Inheritance
Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance, such as multilevel inheritance and multiple inheritance.

class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Mammal(Animal):
    def has_fur(self):
        return True

class Bird(Animal):
    def can_fly(self):
        return True

class Bat(Mammal, Bird):
    def sound(self):
        return "Screech"

bat = Bat()
print(bat.sound())  # Output: Screech
print(bat.has_fur())  # Output: True
print(bat.can_fly())  # Output: True


Summary of Inheritance Types:
Single Inheritance: A single child class inherits from one parent class.
Multiple Inheritance: A child class inherits from multiple parent classes.
Multilevel Inheritance: A child class inherits from a class that is derived from another class.
Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class.
Hybrid Inheritance: A combination of multiple inheritance types, typically multilevel and multiple inheritance.
