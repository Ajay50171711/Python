Decision-Making Statements in Python
Python provides the following decision-making statements:

if Statement: Executes a block of code if a condition is True.
if-else Statement: Executes one block of code if the condition is True and another block if the condition is False.
if-elif-else Statement: Checks multiple conditions sequentially and executes the block of code for the first condition that is True.
Nested if Statements: Allows placing one if statement inside another

if statement
x = 10
if x > 5:  # Condition
    print("x is greater than 5")  # Executes if the condition is True


if-else Statement
x = 3
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 5")


if-elif-else Statement
x = 7
if x < 5:
    print("x is less than 5")
elif x == 7:
    print("x is equal to 7")
else:
    print("x is greater than 5 but not equal to 7")


Nested if Statements
x = 10
if x > 5:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        print("x is greater than 5 and even")
    else:
        print("x is greater than 5 and odd")
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")
