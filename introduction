What is Python?
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is used for:

web development (server-side),
software development,
mathematics

print("Hello, World!")


Python Indentation
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")


Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:

Example
Syntax Error:

if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")


You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:

Example
Syntax Error:

if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!")
        print("Five is greater than two!")
